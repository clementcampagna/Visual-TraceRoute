# Visual TraceRoute

Visual TraceRoute is aptly named as it is a software which provides a visual representation of the traceroute (tracert) command in Windows.
However, it does not rely on the tracert command itself but rather uses C# ping method combined with the use of the ipinfo.io API to gather the required information.

### Configuration:

ipinfo.io limits the use of its API to only a few requests per day for non-registered users. If Visual TraceRoute stops working correctly, please register for a free account on https://ipinfo.io/ and add your own API token to Visual TraceRoute.exe.config
