# Visual TraceRoute

Visual TraceRoute is aptly named as it is a software which provides a visual representation of the traceroute (tracert) command in Windows.\
\
However, it does not rely on the tracert command itself but rather uses C# ping method combined with the use of the ipinfo.io API to gather the required information.\
\
Download Visual TraceRoute and see it for yourself today!\

### Configuration:

ipinfo.io limits the use of its API to only a few requests per day for non-registered users.\
\
If Visual TraceRoute stops working correctly, please register for a free account on https://ipinfo.io/ and add your own API token to Visual TraceRoute.exe.config file.

### Development:

Want to contribute? Great, Visual TraceRoute is open-source!\
